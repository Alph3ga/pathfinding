# Pathfinding

### :wave:Hello user! This is the source code for my interactive webpage; it allows you to place a start and end node, create walls, and then sit back and watch the program find the shortest path between them.

It uses my implementation of the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), an informed search algorithm. It also implements a heap data structure to store and retrieve nodes with optimal time efficiency.
